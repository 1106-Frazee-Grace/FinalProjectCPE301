Here is the Github Repository for our Final Project for CPE 301. 

Group Name: Final Project 14 

Group Members: Grace Frazee and Jakob Kelley

You can find the final report in this repository (with only 1 picture of the circuit) or you can access it through the link. There will be the link to the demonstration video as well since it was too big of a file to add straight to github.
